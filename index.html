        <p><em>Piano Teacher</em></p>
        <p>Hi there! After a 2 year hiatus, I started to miss teaching so I’m looking to get back into inspiring dedicated students.</p>
        <p>In total, I’ve been teaching for about 20 years, and have probably taught around 100 students in a one-to-one setting. Not that I’ve been counting…! And a plethora of students in a group setting too.</p>
        <p>I graduated in 2004 from Sydney Conservatorium of Music, majoring in Piano performance</p>
        <p>I ran All Arts Academy since its inception in 2011 before passing the baton onto new owners in 2017, and now I’m currently working as the Manager at Penrith Conservatorium part time.</p>
        <p>I’ve also taught at MLC School, Burwood, from 2008-2013 as a peripatetic staff member. I also taught piano to preschoolers at Five Dock Montessori, specialising a learning program for very young beginners and pre-readers. I developed a
          curriculum that gave my students an excellent grounding and a headstart as they transition to regular piano lessons as they reached school age.</p>
        <p>I’ve taught students of all ages and levels: young beginners, adult beginners, all the way to advanced students, HSC and university audition entrance exams. I’ve prepped students for all levels AMEB exams (from preliminary to LMus).</p>
        <p>Why don’t you contact me for a free meet and greet? I’d love to hear from you!</p>
